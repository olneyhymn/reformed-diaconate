    <p class="lead">To the reader:</p>

    <p>
    The Reformed churches have always held the office of deacon as essential to the life of the church. Following the pattern of Acts 6, our churches have sought to find "men of good repute, full of the Spirit and of wisdom" to serve the physical needs of the church so our elders can devote themselves to "to prayer and to the ministry of the word". </p>

    <p>Despite the priority we place on this office, I have found relatively little has been written specifically on the office of deacon. As a deacon, I routinely wish to hear more from the wisdom of the ages on how to serve effectively in my office. </p>

    <p>Given this, I started compiling a bibliography of readings in the Reformed diaconate. In hopes that it will be beneficial to others and in hopes that others will <a href="#feedback">suggest other resources</a> that I should read, I share it with you here.
